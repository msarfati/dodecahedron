#  Dodecahedron
by Michael Sarfati (c) 2016

# What it is
- My personal Flask Boilerplate Project
- Inspired by [Flask-Diamond](https://flask-diamond.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) and [Sinatra](www.sinatrarb.com)

# TODO
## Frills
- `dbshell` support

## RESTful API
- [reqparse](https://flask-restful-cn.readthedocs.org/en/0.3.5/reqparse.html) is deprecated, integrate [Marshmallow](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
- Auto-generate schemas from models with [Marshmallow-SQLAlchemy](https://marshmallow-sqlalchemy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
